DbContext in Entity Framework 6 https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/entityframework6/dbcontext.aspx
As you have seen in the previous Create Entity Data Model section, 
EDM includes the SchoolDBEntities class, which is derived from the System.Data.Entity.DbContext class,
as shown below. The class that derives DbContext is called context class in entity framework.

Entity Framework 5.0 Tutorial
DbContext is an important class in Entity Framework API.
It is a bridge between your domain or entity classes and the database.

Entity Framework dbcontext
DbContext is the primary class that is responsible for interacting with the database.
It is responsible for the following activities:

Querying: Converts LINQ-to-Entities queries to SQL query and sends them to the database.
Change Tracking: Keeps track of changes that occurred on the entities after querying from the database.
Persisting Data: Performs the Insert, Update and Delete operations to the database, based on entity states.
Caching: Provides first level caching by default. It stores the entities which have been retrieved during the life time of a context class.
Manage Relationship: Manages relationships using CSDL, MSL and SSDL in Db-First or Model-First approach, and using fluent API configurations in Code-First approach.
Object Materialization: Converts raw data from the database into entity objects.
The following is an example of SchoolDBEntities class (context class that derives from DbContext) generated with EDM for the SchoolDB database in the previous section.

        }
    
        public virtual int sp_UpdateStudent(Nullable<int> studentId, Nullable<int> standardId, string studentName)
        {
            var studentIdParameter = studentId.HasValue ?
                new ObjectParameter("StudentId", studentId) :
                new ObjectParameter("StudentId", typeof(int));
    
            var standardIdParameter = standardId.HasValue ?
                new ObjectParameter("StandardId", standardId) :
                new ObjectParameter("StandardId", typeof(int));
    
            var studentNameParameter = studentName != null ?
                new ObjectParameter("StudentName", studentName) :
                new ObjectParameter("StudentName", typeof(string));
    
            return ((IObjectContextAdapter)this).ObjectContext.ExecuteFunction("sp_UpdateStudent", studentIdParameter, standardIdParameter, studentNameParameter);
        }
    }
}           
As you can see in the above example, the context class (SchoolDBEntities) 
includes the entity set of type DbSet<TEntity> for all the entities. Learn about DbSet class here.
It also includes functions for the stored procedures and views included in EDM.

The OnModelCreating method allows us to configure the model using DbModelBuilder Fluent API in EF 6.


DbContext Methods
Method	Usage
Entry:	Gets an DbEntityEntry for the given entity. The entry provides access to change tracking information and operations for the entity.
SaveChanges:	Executes INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE commands to the database for the entities with Added, Modified and Deleted state.
SaveChangesAsync:	Asynchronous method of SaveChanges()
Set: Creates a DbSet<TEntity> that can be used to query and save instances of TEntity.
OnModelCreating: Override this method to further configure the model that was discovered
by convention from the entity types exposed in DbSet<TEntity> properties on your derived context.


DbContext Properties
Method	Usage
ChangeTracker	Provides access to information and operations for entity instances that this context is tracking.
Configuration	Provides access to configuration options.
Database	Provides access to database related information and operations.

DbSet in Entity Framework 6 https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/entityframework6/dbset.aspx

The DbSet class represents an entity set that can be used for create, read, update, and delete operations.

The context class (derived from DbContext) must include the DbSet type properties for the entities
which map to database tables and views.

The following table lists important methods of the DbSet class:

Add	
Added entity type	
Adds the given entity to the context with the Added state.
When the changes are saved, the entities in the Added states are inserted into the database.
After the changes are saved, the object state changes to Unchanged.
Example:
dbcontext.Students.Add(studentEntity)


AsNoTracking<Entity>
DBQuery<Entity>	
Returns a new query where the entities returned will not be cached in the DbContext. (Inherited from DbQuery.)
Entities returned as AsNoTracking will not be tracked by DBContext. 
This will be a significant performance boost for read-only entities.
Example:
var studentList = dbcontext.Students.AsNoTracking<Student>().ToList<Student>();


Attach(Entity)
Entity which was passed as parameter
Attaches the given entity to the context in the Unchanged state
Example:
dbcontext.Students.Attach(studentEntity);


Create	
Entity	
Creates a new instance of an entity for the type of this set.
This instance is not added or attached to the set.
The instance returned will be a proxy if the underlying context is configured to create proxies 
and the entity type meets the requirements for creating a proxy.
Example:
var newStudentEntity = dbcontext.Students.Create();


Find(int)	
Entity type	Uses the primary key value to find an entity tracked by the context.
If the entity is not in the context,
then a query will be executed and evaluated against the data in the data source, 
and null is returned if the entity is not found in the context or in the data source. 
Note that the Find also returns entities that have been added to the context but have not yet been saved to the database.
Example:
Student studEntity = dbcontext.Students.Find(1);


Include	
DBQuery
Returns the included non-generic LINQ to Entities query against a DbContext. (Inherited from DbQuery)
Example:
var studentList = dbcontext.Students.Include("StudentAddress").ToList<Student>();
var studentList = dbcontext.Students.Include(s => s.StudentAddress).ToList<Student>();


Remove	
Removed entity	
Marks the given entity as Deleted. When the changes are saved, 
the entity is deleted from the database.
The entity must exist in the context in some other state before this method is called.
Example:
dbcontext.Students.Remove(studentEntity);


SqlQuery	
DBSqlQuery	
Creates a raw SQL query that will return entities in this set.
By default, the entities returned are tracked by the context; 
this can be changed by calling AsNoTracking on theDbSqlQuery<TEntity> returned from this method.
Example:
var studentEntity = dbcontext.Students.SqlQuery("select * from student where studentid = 1").FirstOrDefault<Student>();

Relationships between Entities in Entity Framework 6 https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/entity-relationships.aspx

Here, you will learn how entity framework manages the relationships between entities.

Entity framework supports three types of relationships, same as database: 1) One-to-One 2) One-to-Many, and 3) Many-to-Many.

We have created an Entity Data Model for the SchoolDB database in the Create Entity Data Model chapter. The following figure shows the visual designer for that EDM with all the entities and relationships among them.

Entity relationships in entity framework
Let's see how each relationship (association) is being managed by entity framework.

One-to-One Relationship
As you can see in the above figure, 
Student and StudentAddress have a One-to-One relationship (zero or one).
A student can have only one or zero addresses.
Entity framework adds the Student reference navigation property into the StudentAddress entity and the StudentAddress
navigation entity into the Student entity. Also, the StudentAddress entity has both StudentId property as PrimaryKey and ForeignKey,
which makes it a one-to-one relationship.

public partial class Student
{
    public Student()
    {
        this.Courses = new HashSet<Course>();
    }
    
    public int StudentID { get; set; }
    public string StudentName { get; set; }
    public Nullable<int> StandardId { get; set; }
    public byte[] RowVersion { get; set; }
    
    public virtual StudentAddress StudentAddress { get; set; }
    }
    
public partial class StudentAddress
{
    public int StudentID { get; set; }
    public string Address1 { get; set; }
    public string Address2 { get; set; }
    public string City { get; set; }
    public string State { get; set; }
    
    public virtual Student Student { get; set; }
}
In the above example, the StudentId property needs to be PrimaryKey as well as ForeignKey. 
This can be configured using Fluent API in the OnModelCreating method of the context class.

One-to-Many Relationship
The Standard and Teacher entities have a One-to-Many relationship marked by multiplicity where 1 is for One and * is for Many.
This means that Standard can have many Teachers whereas Teacher can associate with only one Standard.

To represent this, the Standard entity has the collection navigation property Teachers (please notice that it's plural),
which indicates that one Standard can have a collection of Teachers (many teachers).
And the Teacher entity has a Standard navigation property (reference property), 
which indicates that Teacher is associated with one Standard. Also, it contains the StandardId foreign key (PK in Standard entity). 
This makes it a One-to-Many relationship.

public partial class Standard
{
    public Standard()
    {
        this.Teachers = new HashSet<Teacher>();
    }
    
    public int StandardId { get; set; }
    public string StandardName { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    
    public virtual ICollection<Teacher> Teachers { get; set; }
}

public partial class Teacher
{
    public Teacher()
    {
        this.Courses = new HashSet<Course>();
    }
    
    public int TeacherId { get; set; }
    public string TeacherName { get; set; }
    public Nullable<int> TeacherType { get; set; }
    
    public Nullable<int> StandardId { get; set; }
    public virtual Standard Standard { get; set; }
}
Many-to-Many Relationship
The Student and Course have a Many-to-Many relationship marked by * multiplicity.
It means one Student can enroll for many Courses and also, one Course can be taught to many Students.

The database includes the StudentCourse joining table which includes the primary key of both the tables (Student and Course tables). 
Entity Framework represents many-to-many relationships by not having the entity set (DbSet property) 
for the joining table in the CSDL and visual designer. Instead it manages this through mapping.

As you can see in the above figure, the Student entity includes the collection navigation property Courses and Course entity 
includes the collection navigation property Students to represent a many-to-many relationship between them.

The following code snippet shows the Student and Course entity classes.

public partial class Student
{
    public Student()
    {
        this.Courses = new HashSet<Course>();
    }
    
    public int StudentID { get; set; }
    public string StudentName { get; set; }
    public Nullable<int> StandardId { get; set; }
    public byte[] RowVersion { get; set; }
    
    public virtual ICollection<Course> Courses { get; set; }
}
    
public partial class Course
{
    public Course()
    {
        this.Students = new HashSet<Student>();
    }
    
    public int CourseId { get; set; }
    public string CourseName { get; set; }
    public System.Data.Entity.Spatial.DbGeography Location { get; set; }
    
    public virtual ICollection<Student> Students { get; set; }
}
Note: Entity framework supports many-to-many relationships only when the joining table (StudentCourse in this case)
does NOT include any columns other than PKs of both tables. 
If the join tables contain additional columns, such as DateCreated, then the EDM creates an entity for the middle table as well
and you will have to manage CRUD operations for many-to-many entities manually.

Open EDM in XML view. You can see that SSDL (storage schema) has the StudentCourse entityset,
but CSDL doesn't have it. Instead, it's being mapped in the navigation property of the Student and Course entities.
MSL (C-S Mapping) has mapping between Student and Course put into the StudentCourse table in the <AssociationSetMapping/> section.


Saving Data in the Connected Scenario  https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/crud-operation-in-connected-scenario-entity-framework.aspx

Saving entity data in the connected scenario is a fairly easy task because the context automatically tracks 
the changes that happened on the entity during its lifetime.

Here, we will use the same EDM for CRUD operations which we created in the Create Entity Data Model chapter.
An entity which contains data in its scalar property will be either inserted, updated or deleted, based on its EntityState.

In the Entity Framework, there are two persistence scenarios to save an entity data: connected and disconnected. 
In the connected scenario, the same instance of DbContext is used in retrieving and saving entities, 
whereas this is different in the disconnected scenario.
In this chapter, you will learn about saving data in the connected scenario.

The following figure illustrates the CUD (Create, Update, Delete) operations in the connected scenario.


As per the above figure, Entity Framework builds and executes INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements 
for the entities whose EntityState is Added, Modified, or Deleted when the DbContext.SaveChanges() method is called. 
In the connected scenario, an instance of DbContext keeps track of all the entities and so, it automatically sets an appropriate EntityState to each entity whenever an entity is created, modified, or deleted.

Insert Data
Use the DbSet.Add method to add a new entity to a context (instance of DbContext),
which will insert a new record in the database when you call the SaveChanges() method.

using (var context = new SchoolDBEntities())
{
    var std = new Student()
    {
        FirstName = "Bill",
        LastName = "Gates"
    };
    context.Students.Add(std);

    context.SaveChanges();
}
In the above example, context.Students.Add(std) adds a newly created instance of the Student entity to a context with Added EntityState. The context.SaveChanges() method builds and executes the following INSERT statement to the database.

exec sp_executesql N'INSERT [dbo].[Students]([FirstName], [LastName])
VALUES (@0, @1)
SELECT [StudentId]
FROM [dbo].[Students]
WHERE @@ROWCOUNT > 0 AND [StudentId] = scope_identity()',N
''@0 nvarchar(max) ,@1 nvarchar(max) ',@0=N'Bill',@1=N'Gates'
go
Updating Data
In the connected scenario, EF API keeps track of all the entities retrieved using a context.
Therefore, when you edit entity data, EF automatically marks EntityState to Modified,
which results in an updated statement in the database when you call the SaveChanges() method.

using (var context = new SchoolDBEntities())
{
    var std = context.Students.First<Student>(); 
    std.FirstName = "Steve";
    context.SaveChanges();
}
In the above example, we retrieve the first student from the database using context.Students.First<student>().
As soon as we modify the FirstName,
the context sets its EntityState to Modified because of the modification performed in the scope of the DbContext instance (context). 
So, when we call the SaveChanges() method, it builds and executes the following Update statement in the database.

exec sp_executesql N'UPDATE [dbo].[Students]
SET [FirstName] = @0
WHERE ([StudentId] = @1)',
N'@0 nvarchar(max) ,@1 int',@0=N'Steve',@1=2
Go
In an update statement, EF API includes the properties with modified values, 
other properties being ignored. In the above example, only the FirstName property was edited, 
so an update statement includes only the FirstName column.

Deleting Data
Use the DbSet.Remove() method to delete a record in the database table.

using (var context = new SchoolDBEntities())
{
    var std = context.Students.First<Student>();
    context.Students.Remove(std);

    context.SaveChanges();
}
In the above example, context.Students.Remove(std) marks the std entity object as Deleted.
Therefore, EF will build and execute the following DELETE statement in the database.

exec sp_executesql N'DELETE [dbo].[Students]
WHERE ([StudentId] = @0)',N'@0 int',@0=1
Go


Querying in Entity Framework https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/Querying-with-EDM.aspx
You can build and execute queries using Entity Framework to fetch the data from the underlying database. EF 6 supports different types of queries which in turn convert into SQL queries for the underlying database.

Entity framework supports three types of queries: 1) LINQ-to-Entities, 2) Entity SQL, and 3) Native SQL

LINQ-to-Entities
Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) is a powerful query language introduced in Visual Studio 2008. As the name suggests, LINQ-to-Entities queries operate on the entity set (DbSet type properties) to access the data from the underlying database. You can use the LINQ method syntax or query syntax when querying with EDM. Visit LINQ Tutorials to learn LINQ step-by-step.

The following sample LINQ-to-Entities query fetches the data from the Student table in the database.

LINQ Method syntax:

//Querying with LINQ to Entities 
using (var context = new SchoolDBEntities())
{
    var query = context.Students
                       .where(s => s.StudentName == "Bill")
                       .FirstOrDefault<Student>();
}
LINQ Query syntax:

using (var context = new SchoolDBEntities())
{
    var query = from st in context.Students
                where st.StudentName == "Bill"
                select st;
   
    var student = query.FirstOrDefault<Student>();
}
As you can see above, we created an instance of the context class SchoolDBEntities. It is recommended to instantiate it in using(), so that once it goes out of scope, then it automatically gets disposed.

Learn different types of LINQ-to-Entities projection query in the next chapter.

Entity SQL
Entity SQL is another way to create a query. It is processed by the Entity Framework's Object Services directly. It returns ObjectQuery instead of IQueryable.

You need an ObjectContext to create a query using Entity SQL.

The following code snippet shows the same query result as the LINQ query above.

//Querying with Object Services and Entity SQL
string sqlString = "SELECT VALUE st FROM SchoolDBEntities.Students " +
                    "AS st WHERE st.StudentName == 'Bill'";
    
var objctx = (ctx as IObjectContextAdapter).ObjectContext;
                
ObjectQuery<Student> student = objctx.CreateQuery<Student>(sqlString);
Student newStudent = student.First<Student>();
You can also use EntityConnection and EntityCommand to execute Entity SQL as shown below:

using (var con = new EntityConnection("name=SchoolDBEntities"))
{
    con.Open();
    EntityCommand cmd = con.CreateCommand();
    cmd.CommandText = "SELECT VALUE st FROM SchoolDBEntities.Students as st where st.StudentName='Bill'";
    Dictionary<int, string> dict = new Dictionary<int, string>();
    using (EntityDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader(CommandBehavior.SequentialAccess | CommandBehavior.CloseConnection))
    {
            while (rdr.Read())
            {
                int a = rdr.GetInt32(0);
                var b = rdr.GetString(1);
                dict.Add(a, b);
            }
    }               
}
Visit MSDN blog to learn Entity SQL.

Native SQL
You can execute native SQL queries for a relational database, as shown below:

using (var ctx = new SchoolDBEntities())
{
    var studentName = ctx.Students.SqlQuery("Select studentid, studentname, standardId from Student where studentname='Bill'").FirstOrDefault<Student>();
}    
Learn to execute raw sql queries using DbContext in Raw SQL Query chapter.


Linq-to-Entities Query https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/querying-entity-graph-in-entity-framework.aspx
Here, you will learn how to write LINQ-to-Entities queries and get the result in Entity Framework 6.x as well as in Entity Framework Core. Visit LINQ Tutorials to learn LINQ step by step.

The DbSet class is derived from IQuerayable. So, we can use LINQ for querying against DbSet, which will be converted to an SQL query. EF API executes this SQL query to the underlying database, gets the flat result set, converts it into appropriate entity objects and returns it as a query result.

The following are some of the standard query operators (or extension methods) that can be used with LINQ-to-Entities queries.

LINQ Extension Methods
First()
FirstOrDefault()
Single()
SingleOrDefault()
ToList()
Count()
Min()
Max()
Last()
LastOrDefault()
Average()
Find()
In addition to LINQ extension methods, we can use the Find() method of DbSet to search the entity based on the primary key value.

Let's assume that SchoolDbEntities is our DbContext class and Students is the DbSet property.

var ctx = new SchoolDBEntities();
var student = ctx.Students.Find(1);
In the above example, ctx.Student.Find(1) returns a student record whose StudentId is 1 in the database. If no record is found, then it returns null. The above query will execute the following SQL query.

SELECT 
[Extent1].[StudentID] AS [StudentID], 
[Extent1].[StudentName] AS [StudentName], 
[Extent1].[StandardId] AS [StandardId]
FROM [dbo].[Student] AS [Extent1]
WHERE [Extent1].[StudentId] = @p0',N'@p0 int',@p0=1
go
First/FirstOrDefault
If you want to get a single student object, when there are many students, whose name is "Bill" in the database, then use First or FirstOrDefault, as shown below:

LINQ Query Syntax:

using (var ctx = new SchoolDBEntities())
{    
    var student = (from s in ctx.Students
                where s.StudentName == "Bill"
                select s).FirstOrDefault<Student>();
}
LINQ Method Syntax:

using (var ctx = new SchoolDBEntities())
{    
    var student = ctx.Students
                    .Where(s => s.StudentName == "Bill")
                    .FirstOrDefault<Student>();
}
EF 6 executes the following SQL query in the database for the above LINQ query.

SELECT TOP (1) 
[Extent1].[StudentID] AS [StudentID], 
[Extent1].[StudentName] AS [StudentName], 
[Extent1].[StandardId] AS [StandardId]
FROM [dbo].[Student] AS [Extent1]
WHERE 'Bill' = [Extent1].[StudentName]
EF Core executes the following query in the database.

SELECT TOP (1) 
[s].[StudentId], [s].[DoB], [s].[FirstName], [s].[GradeId], 
[s].[LastName], [s].[MiddleName]
FROM [Students] AS [s]
WHERE [s].[FirstName] = N'Bill'
Parameterized Query
EF builds and executes a parameterized query in the database if the LINQ-to-Entities query uses parameters, such as below.

using (var ctx = new SchoolDBEntities())
{    
    string name = "Bill";
    var student = ctx.Students
                  .Where(s => s.StudentName == name)
                  .FirstOrDefault<Student>();
}
The above query will result into the following SQL query in EF 6.

SELECT TOP (1) 
[Extent1].[StudentId] AS [StudentId], 
[Extent1].[Name] AS [Name]
FROM [dbo].[Student] AS [Extent1]
WHERE ([Extent1].[Name] = @p__linq__0) OR (([Extent1].[Name] IS NULL) 
         AND (@p__linq__0 IS NULL))',N'@p__linq__0 nvarchar(4000)',@p__linq__0=N'Bill'
The difference between First and FirstOrDefault is that First() will throw an exception if there is no result data for the supplied criteria, whereas FirstOrDefault() returns a default value (null) if there is no result data.

ToList
The ToList method returns the collection result. If you want to list all the students with the same name then use ToList():

using (var ctx = new SchoolDBEntities())
{    
    var studentList = ctx.Students.Where(s => s.StudentName == "Bill").ToList();
}
We may also use ToArray, ToDictionary or ToLookup. The above query would result in the following database query:

SELECT 
[Extent1].[StudentID] AS [StudentID], 
[Extent1].[StudentName] AS [StudentName], 
[Extent1].[StandardId] AS [StandardId]
FROM [dbo].[Student] AS [Extent1]
WHERE 'Bill' = [Extent1].[StudentName]
go
GroupBy
Use the group by operator or GroupBy extension method to get the result based on the group by the particular property of an entity.

The following example gets the results grouped by each Standard. Use the foreach loop to iterate the group.

LINQ Query Syntax:

using (var ctx = new SchoolDBEntities())
{    
    var students = from s in ctx.Students 
                    group s by s.StandardId into studentsByStandard
                    select studentsByStandard;

    foreach (var groupItem in students)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(groupItem.Key);

        foreach (var stud in groupItem)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(stud.StudentId);
        }

    }
}
    
LINQ Method Syntax:

using (var ctx = new SchoolDBEntities())
{    
    var students = ctx.Students.GroupBy(s => s.StandardId);

    foreach (var groupItem in students)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(groupItem.Key);

        foreach (var stud in groupItem)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(stud.StudentId);
        }

    }
}
    
The above query will execute the following database query:

SELECT 
[Project2].[C1] AS [C1], 
[Project2].[StandardId] AS [StandardId], 
[Project2].[C2] AS [C2], 
[Project2].[StudentID] AS [StudentID], 
[Project2].[StudentName] AS [StudentName], 
[Project2].[StandardId1] AS [StandardId1]
FROM ( SELECT 
    [Distinct1].[StandardId] AS [StandardId], 
    1 AS [C1], 
    [Extent2].[StudentID] AS [StudentID], 
    [Extent2].[StudentName] AS [StudentName], 
    [Extent2].[StandardId] AS [StandardId1], 
    CASE WHEN ([Extent2].[StudentID] IS NULL) THEN CAST(NULL AS int) ELSE 1 END AS [C2]
    FROM   (SELECT DISTINCT 
        [Extent1].[StandardId] AS [StandardId]
        FROM [dbo].[Student] AS [Extent1] ) AS [Distinct1]
    LEFT OUTER JOIN [dbo].[Student] AS [Extent2] ON ([Distinct1].[StandardId] = [Extent2].[StandardId]) OR (([Distinct1].[StandardId] IS NULL) AND ([Extent2].[StandardId] IS NULL))
)  AS [Project2]
ORDER BY [Project2].[StandardId] ASC, [Project2].[C2] ASC
go
OrderBy
Use the OrderBy operator with ascending/descending keywords in LINQ query syntax to get the sorted entity list.

using (var ctx = new SchoolDBEntities())
{    
        var students = from s in ctx.Students
                       orderby s.StudentName ascending
                       select s;
}
Use the OrderBy or OrderByDescending method to get the sorted entity list.

using (var ctx = new SchoolDBEntities())
{    
        var students = ctx.Students.OrderBy(s => s.StudentName).ToList();
        // or descending order  
        var  descStudents = ctx.Students.OrderByDescending(s => s.StudentName).ToList();
}
The above query will execute the following database query:

SELECT 
[Extent1].[StudentID] AS [StudentID], 
[Extent1].[StudentName] AS [StudentName], 
[Extent1].[StandardId] AS [StandardId]
FROM [dbo].[Student] AS [Extent1]
ORDER BY [Extent1].[StudentName] ASC
go
Anonymous Object Result
LINQ-to-Entities queries do not always have to return entity objects. We may choose some of the properties of an entity as a result.

The following query returns a list of anonymous objects which contains StudentId and StudentName properties.

LINQ Query Syntax:

using (var ctx = new SchoolDBEntities())
{    
    var anonymousObjResult = from s in ctx.Students
                             where s.StandardId == 1
                             select new { 
                                Id = st.StudentId, 
                                Name = st.StudentName
                             };

    foreach (var obj in anonymousObjResult)
    {
        Console.Write(obj.Name);
    }
}
LINQ Method Syntax:

using (var ctx = new SchoolDBEntities())
{    
    var anonymousObjResult = ctx.Students
                                .Where(st => st.Standard == 1)
                                .Select(st => new { 
                                            Id = st.StudentId, 
                                            Name = st.StudentName });

    foreach (var obj in anonymousObjResult)
    {
        Console.Write(obj.Name);
    }
}
The above query will execute the following database query:

SELECT 
[s].[StudentID] AS [Id], [s].[StudentName] AS [Name]
FROM [Student] AS [s]
WHERE [s].[StandardId] = 1
go
The projectionResult in the above query will be the anonymous type, because there is no class/entity which has these properties. So, the compiler will mark it as anonymous.

Nested queries
You can also execute nested LINQ-to-entity queries as shown below:

entity relationships in entity framework
The nested query shown above will result in an anonymous list with a StudentName and Course object.

SELECT 
[Extent1].[StudentID] AS [StudentID], 
[Extent1].[StudentName] AS [StudentName], 
[Join1].[CourseId1] AS [CourseId], 
[Join1].[CourseName] AS [CourseName], 
[Join1].[Location] AS [Location], 
[Join1].[TeacherId] AS [TeacherId]
FROM  [dbo].[Student] AS [Extent1]
INNER JOIN  (SELECT [Extent2].[StudentId] AS [StudentId], 
        [Extent3].[CourseId] AS [CourseId1], [Extent3].[CourseName] AS [CourseName], 
        [Extent3].[Location] AS [Location], [Extent3].[TeacherId] AS [TeacherId]
    FROM  [dbo].[StudentCourse] AS [Extent2]
    INNER JOIN [dbo].[Course] AS [Extent3] 
        ON [Extent3].[CourseId] = [Extent2].[CourseId] ) AS [Join1] 
        ON [Extent1].[StudentID] = [Join1].[StudentId]
WHERE 1 = [Extent1].[StandardId]
go
